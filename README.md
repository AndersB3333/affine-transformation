# affine-transformation

This program is displaying the linear transformation concept by affine transformation of an image.
The program does only use basic numpy operations, for personal understanding of the process. It does
neither contain bicubic interpolation, so when the image gets manipulated, such as stretched, the output
will be a darker image due to black pixels replacing the empty pixels.
